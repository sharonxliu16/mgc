Hi! First off, congratulations on being elected onto the MGC Executive Board! This code will help you do attendance, as it will automate a lot of names so that you only have to cross check a select few rather than the entire list.

First, make sure you are getting an updated list from OFSL for each members' status, name, and email. This will be what is inputted into the masterDict, and should be updated every semester. It should not include any inactives and associates.

You can copy and paste the code into repl.it as a guest and run it. There is no need to use VScode.

Next, when you are inputting those that are excused and those that filled out the attendance form when present, make sure they are separated by spaces. A good way to do this is to copy a list of the emails from the google sheets (derived from the google forms) and paste them on a google doc, and adding a space at the end of each email. Then, copy and paste them again and enter into the corresponding inputs.

The remaining output should give you the email, name, and organization of all the unexcused absences. 

IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT YOU DOUBLE/CROSS CHECK THIS LIST. While this code should be fairly accurate, it is not uncommon for people to mispell or for it to miss something. Therefore, you must cross check each unexcused absence with the excuse google sheet and the attendance google sheet through Ctrl+f.
